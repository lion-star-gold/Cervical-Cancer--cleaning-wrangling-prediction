# Cervical-Cancer--cleaning-wrangling-prediction
A self led project, cleaning and imputing data, before performing KNN on portioned data to predict a positive Cancer case or not.

In this project I use pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, and sklearn to:
* clean the dataframe
* impute missing values
* order + reorder the dataframe
* brief visualisations of age 
* splitting data to train + test 
* performing KNN 
* improving KNN 

I am interested in performing more predictive methods on more health related data, and will seek out datasets from the UCI ML site and Kaggle.
